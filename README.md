# Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?

# How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?

# How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?

# Who is the target audience? Who will use your app or play your game?

# What is the scope of your project?

# Does this project have many individual features or one main feature (a possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.


# What are the epics? For example, as a regular user of your site, what general actions/features can I perform? You may choose to start creating some UI mockups on paper. This may help determine your initial features.

As a regular user of our web app, the actions/features depend on the role (Student, Professor, Admin). These are the main epics of our project:

1. Student Attendance Epic-
• Log into the website using StudentID and Password
• View an interactive classroom map
• See which seats are available (green = empty, red = taken)
• Click a seat to mark attendance

This makes attendance faster and more efficient.

2. Professor Monitoring Epic-
• Log into the website using ProfID and Password
• View the classroom seat map
• See which students are present in real time
• See which seats are taken or empty
• Track attendance automatically without calling names

This reduces time spent on manual attendance and improves accuracy.

3. Admin Management Epic-
• Manage student and professor accounts
• Add or remove classrooms
• View attendance reports
• Access historical attendance records
• Maintain overall system control

This ensures the system remains organized and secure.

# Is the amount of work required in this proposal sufficient for five group members? A rough rule of thumb is that each group member should have one major feature.

Yes, the workload is sufficient for five group members because each epic is a major feature that includes frontend, backend, database integration, and testing. The work can be divided as:
• Member 1 (ArshSaran):  Student Attendance Check-In Module
• Member 2:  
• Member 3:  
• Member 4
• Member 5:

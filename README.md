## Name of Web Application

## Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?

Fraser International College wants an attendance tracker for their classrooms. 

There are three potential views of the web app which include Professors, Students, and Admins

Students will be able to log into the website with their credentials (StudentID, Password) via the auth/login page.
Then, they'll be presented with an interactive map of the classroom, with clickable seats that display if the seat is taken or not (green and red).
After choosing a seat, they will be assessed as present in the class.

Professors will be able to log into the website with their credentials (ProfID, Password) via the auth/login page.
Then, they'll be presented with a map of student seats and see which students are in attendance. 
An additional feature is the ability to adjust the desk setups when needed.

Admins will be able to log into the website with their credentials (AdminID, Password) via the auth/login page. 
Then, they’ll be presented with a map of student seats and other admin features such as removing students.

## How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?

## How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?

## Who is the target audience? Who will use your app or play your game?

## What is the scope of your project?

## Does this project have many individual features or one main feature (a possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.


## What are the epics? For example, as a regular user of your site, what general actions/features can I perform? You may choose to start creating some UI mockups on paper. This may help determine your initial features.

As a regular user of our web app, the actions/features depend on the role (Student, Professor, Admin). These are the main epics of our project:

### 1. Student Attendance Epic-
- Log into the website using StudentID and Password
- View an interactive classroom map
- See which seats are available (green = empty, red = taken)
- Click a seat to mark attendance

This makes attendance faster and more efficient.

### 2. Professor Monitoring Epic-
- Log into the website using ProfID and Password
- View the classroom seat map
- See which students are present in real time
- See which seats are taken or empty
- Track attendance automatically without calling names

This reduces time spent on manual attendance and improves accuracy.

### 3. Admin Management Epic-
- Manage student and professor accounts
- Add or remove classrooms
- View attendance reports
- Access historical attendance records
- Maintain overall system control

This ensures the system remains organized and secure.

## Is the amount of work required in this proposal sufficient for five group members? A rough rule of thumb is that each group member should have one major feature.

Yes, the workload is sufficient for five group members because each epic is a major feature that includes frontend, backend, database integration, and testing. The work can be divided as:
- Member 1 (ArshSaran):  Student Attendance Check-In Module
- Member 2:
- Member 3:
- Member 4
- Member 5:
